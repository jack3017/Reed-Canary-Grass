These are examples of the output we created. These were made into PNGs because the .tifs were too large to upload. Image 1 shows a combined virtual raster of all our bands together. Image 2 shows a closup of one plot of this. Image 3 shows this image after it has been classified using MLE. Image 4 shows the numbers behind this output showing how many pixels of each class  were present.
