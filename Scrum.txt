Sprint 2: 
	Scrum Master: 	Jack McConnell
	Scrum Dates: 	Winter Break
	Sprint Goal:	Re-seperate the photos into INDIVIDUAL .tif files, figure out how to perform (even rudimentary) spectral pattern recognition on a .tif file, make a basic script than can perform the analysis on each plot file and export data to a different file (that part should be simple-ish)
